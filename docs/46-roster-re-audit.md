# 46 — The Roster Re-Audit

**Started 2026-09-16.** Chapter 45 says *"13 of 29 reference Servants are fully authored"* and
then says the claim is unreliable: *"'authored' is a claim only a live board can settle. Asterios
and Karna were both on this list while six of Asterios's clauses had no reader and nine of Karna's
thirteen abilities did not exist."*

This chapter is the re-audit that takes that seriously. One Servant at a time, every paragraph of
the original sheet held against a reader and then pressed in a running world.

It exists because the **first** Servant audited — Heracles, on the "fully authored" list since the
list was written — moved four things, and **only one of the four was his**. The other three were
general defects that his sheet happened to be standing on. A per-Servant audit that records its
findings only in that Servant's case chapter loses exactly the findings that matter most.

So: §46.4 is the register of what is wrong for **everybody**, and §46.5 is the checklist to run
against each Servant. Both are living; each audit appends to them.

---

## 46.1 What an audit is

Two passes, and the second is not optional.

**Pass 1 — the paper trace.** Every paragraph of `char_orig_sheets/Copia de <name>.md` is a claim.
Trace each one: *sheet clause → rule element in the YAML → the engine reader that consumes it*.
A clause whose element has no reader is **Collected**, which Ch. 45 defines and which this
project's dominant defect shape. A clause whose reader is asked the *wrong question* looks
identical on paper and is not caught here — which is why there is a second pass.

**Pass 2 — the live board.** Import the Servant **fresh from the compiled pack**, put it in a real
match, and press every ability through the interface. Read the sheet, the chat card and the audit
log, not the return value.

> Green unit tests are not evidence. Every fixture in `sheet-present.test.mjs` used the document
> shape of `health`, so the code and the tests agreed with each other and not with the system, and
> the defect in §46.4-A survived every one of 4,724 passing tests.

An audit is finished when every clause has been *seen working on a board*, and the findings are
filed: Servant-specific ones in that Servant's case chapter, general ones in §46.4 here.

## 46.2 Measurement hazards

Every one of these was hit during the Heracles audit, and two of them produced a **wrong finding
that was reported before being retracted**. Check them before trusting a number.

| Hazard | What it looks like | Guard |
|---|---|---|
| **Two GM connections** | Every scheduled effect ticks **twice** — drains, periodics, cooldowns, expiries. A stated 20 measures as 40 | Count `/game` *pages*, not users. `game.users.filter(u => u.active)` shows **one**, because Foundry tracks activity per user and not per connection (§46.4-D) |
| **Round boundaries** | A drain reads as a heal. Home Base regeneration fires at round end and can exceed the toll | Record `combat.round` before and after every measured Turn; discard trials where it changed |
| **Stale test actors** | A Servant with numbers matching no table — a Heracles at 1600 Health with END A, which the table puts at 1500 | Import fresh from the pack for every audit. Never reuse a previous session's actor |
| **Hand-built combats** | `Combat.create` + a hand-bumped `round`/`globalTurn` is not what the war-setup flow produces | Acceptable for isolating a clause; say so when reporting, and re-measure through the real flow before calling something a rules defect |
| **Pack staleness** | Content edits do not reach a running world | `node tools/fgt-world.mjs rebuild`, then re-import the actor |
| **Reading a Combat Process before it finishes** | An attack looks as though it applied nothing | Check `message.flags.fgt.process.state` and its `history`. A Process can be waiting on the **attacker's own** damage-step prompt while the pending panel advertises only the *defender's* reaction, and that dialog can take seconds to render. `advanceProcess` awaits it, so calling the socket directly looks like a hang. This produced a retracted "clause 2 applies nothing" against Asterios |
| **The first `nextTurn` after `startCombat`** | The turn-end sequence does not fire | Discard the first trial; measure from the second |

**The general rule this produces:** when a measurement disagrees with a sheet, isolate the *pure*
layer first. Call the rules function directly with a hand-built board. If the pure layer is right
and the live board is wrong, the defect is in orchestration or in the harness — and the harness is
the more likely of the two.

---

## 46.3 Recurring defect shapes

Not a list of bugs; a list of *kinds*. Each has been seen at least once, and each is worth
actively looking for rather than waiting to trip over.

| Shape | The question to ask |
|---|---|
| **Collected but unread** | Is there a reader for this field, and is it reached? `grep` the field name and discount the authoring module |
| **Two shapes of the same value** | Does this read `x.health.value` against a **snapshot**, where `health` is a bare number? `domain/health.mjs` exists for this and lists its own casualties |
| **The gate and the display disagree** | Does the rules layer answer this question in one place and the presenter in another? Two readers of one rule always drift, and the player believes the sheet |
| **A shared template that over-grants** | Does every bearer of this class skill actually carry every clause the template authors? Six Mad Enhancement sheets print three different shapes (§46.4-C) |
| **Absolute where the sheet is silent** | Does the sheet state a reach/duration/count for this ability, or is it inheriting the unit's? An authored `range: 1` freezes a number a buff was meant to move |
| **Per-resolution vs. per-unit** | Does this counter tick once per *event* where the rule counts *things*? God Hand spent three charges and recorded one use |
| **Name drift across a boundary** | Does the reader spell the field the way the schema does? `alignment.moral` vs `morality`; a kebab-case slug against a camelCase predicate |
| **Two fields, one winner** | Does this element state two settings where the first silently discards the second? `range:` beats `rangeBonus:` in `anchorRange`, with no warning |
| **An event with no firer** | Is anything calling `fireEvent` for the event this handler names? |

---

## 46.4 The cross-cutting register

Findings that are **not one Servant's**. Each entry says who it reaches and whether it is closed.

### A. `abilityCost` read a Master's Health in the wrong shape — **fixed 2026-09-16**

**Reached: every Servant in the game.** `present.mjs#abilityCost` read `master?.health?.value ?? 0`,
and the Master `context.mjs` hands it is the **board's projection**, where `snapshotUnit` flattens
`health` to a bare number. So `.value` was `undefined`, the `?? 0` made every Master destitute, and
every Noble Phantasm reported *"Master cost 40 Health (HT Master has 0) ✗ cannot be paid"* with
that Master standing at 250/250.

Worse than a display bug on its own: `cannotPay` in `rules/costs.mjs` was already correct, so the
**gate allowed the press while the sheet denied it**. The player believes the sheet.

This is the fourth site in `domain/health.mjs`'s own header list and the one that got away — that
module was written *because of* this bug class, and repaired `cannotPay` while missing the
presenter beside it. Ch. 29 §29.2.

### B. `cannotDeactivate` was bypassed by every forced path — **fixed 2026-09-16**

**Reached: every mode carrying the flag** — Heracles's Mad Enhancement, Mannanán's Holder Mode, and
anything authored with it later. `rules/modes.mjs` has refused a **player's** click on the flag
since it was written; the forced paths (a scheduler `SetMode`, an ability's `setMode` phase, a
Noble Phantasm's) all write through `io.setMode`, which read `system.active` and nothing else.

Nothing re-armed the mode afterwards either: `reconcileForcedModes` only re-arms a mode held on by
a **compulsion** or a **`ForceMode`** rule, and *"cannot be deactivated"* is neither.

The asymmetry to preserve when touching this: `cannotDeactivate` says NEVER and `toggleLock` says
HOW LONG YOU WAIT, so a forcible deactivation still beats the lockout and does not beat the flag.
A Command Spell is unaffected — it spends itself through `suspendSkill`, a different write, which
is what makes the sheets that sell a suspension for one Command Spell work at all. Ch. 15 §15.6.

### C. The Mad Enhancement template over-granted clause 1 — **fixed 2026-09-16, one residue open**

**Reached: Asterios, Castor, Kingprotea** (and, less exactly, Penthesilea and Raikou).

`class-mad-enhancement.yml` authors **both** halves of clause 1 for every bearer. The six sheets
carrying Mad Enhancement print **three** shapes:

| Sheet | Clause 1 |
|---|---|
| **Heracles** | a floor, **no** forced deactivation — *"its Master's Health cannot drop below 20 in this way"* |
| **Asterios, Castor, Kingprotea** | a forced deactivation, **no** floor — *"when its Master's Health is 20 or less, ME is forcibly deactivated"* |
| **Penthesilea, Raikou** | **both**, with the floor conditional — *"while the Skill does not meet the condition to be deactivated, its Master's Health cannot drop below 30 in this way"* |

§46.4-B makes Heracles correct in outcome, because his own `cannotDeactivate` refuses the forced
half. Asterios, Castor and Kingprotea still receive a floor their sheets do not grant — worth 10
Health on the Turn their Master crosses the threshold. Penthesilea's and Raikou's floor is
unconditional where their sheets make it conditional.

**Fixed as a parameterized template, not as three templates.** `substitute` replaced whole-string
`@name` placeholders only, so a clause could not be omitted per instantiation. It can now:
`onlyIf: "@param"` marks a clause only some bearers carry, and `prune` in `tools/lib/content.mjs`
drops it at **build** time — so the compiled document says what that Servant HAS rather than what
the template could have given it. Splitting the file into three would have meant six numbers
obliged to stay in step, which is the failure `substitute` exists to prevent; a `predicate` would
have been wrong for a different reason — this is not a question about the board, it is a question
about whose sheet it is, and it has an answer at build time.

`floorTable: "@drainFloor"` carries the other half (`null` for a bearer with no floor;
`elements.mjs` reads `if (a.floorTable)` and leaves the deduction unclamped). Both parameters are
**required** rather than defaulted: a default would silently hand a new bearer whichever shape
happened to be commonest, and that is the whole finding.

**Measured live** — Asterios: Master at 30 goes to **10**, and Mad Enhancement forcibly off.
Heracles on the same board: Master at 30 goes to **20**, and the mode holds.

**The residue.** Penthesilea's and Raikou's floor is *conditional* — *"while the Skill does not meet
the condition to be deactivated"* — and is still authored as an unconditional one, because the
predicate it needs ("this mode is currently held on") has no vocabulary: `rules/options.mjs` emits
`self:skillActive:<slug>` and nothing about being compelled or forced. Settle it with their audits,
where their whole kit is in view.

### D. `isScheduler()` elects a GM *user*, not a connection — **open**

**Reached: every scheduled effect, in any session with two tabs open on one Gamemaster.**

`game.users.activeGM?.isSelf` is true for **every connection that user holds**, so two windows on
one GM each run the whole turn-end sequence: drains, periodics, cooldown advances, expiries all
tick twice. The election is correct against two *different* GM users and does nothing against two
tabs of one.

It matters more here than it would elsewhere because `tools/fgt-world.mjs join` opens a tab and
opening a second is one click — which is exactly how it was found, and it produced a clean ×2 on
Mad Enhancement's Master drain that was reported as a rules defect before the second writer was
traced to a socket update arriving from the other tab.

**It is a measurement hazard before it is a gameplay bug** (§46.2). The shape that closes it is a
per-connection lock on the combat document rather than a per-user election.

### E. `forbidCivilians: "ifGoodAligned"` can never fire — **open, inert**

`rules/targeting/resolve.mjs` reads `caster.alignment?.moral`; the schema field is `morality`
(`data/actor/servant.mjs`), which is what `environment.mjs` and the sheet context both read. The
gate is therefore permanently false.

Inert today — **no content uses the limit.** It becomes live the moment a good-aligned Servant with
an area Noble Phantasm is authored, which is a thing several sheets want.

### F. An element that states two settings where one wins — **fixed 2026-09-16**

`anchorRange` returns an absolute `spec.range` immediately and only falls through to
`caster.range + rangeBonus` when `range` is absent. Two ability files state **both**:

- `anastasia-ice-block-launcher.yml` — `range: 3, rangeBonus: 3`
- `anastasia-snegleta.yml` — `range: 3, rangeBonus: 1`

The bonus was discarded in both, silently — and her sheet settles the intent in its own words:
*"Range+3 for the Combat Process"* and *"Range+1 for the Combat Process"*, which is `rangeBonus`
and exactly the idiom `anchorRange`'s docstring names. Both anchors now drop the absolute `range:`.
Her Range is 3, so Ice Block Launcher reached 3 panels rather than 6, and its Instakill ceiling sat
at 15% against the 30% the comment beside it asserted.

**The validator now refuses an anchor carrying both**, which is the half that stops it recurring:
`range:` is for a reach the sheet prints, `rangeBonus:` for one stated relative to the unit's own
Range.

### H. A bounded field's escape ladder was offered by nobody — **fixed 2026-09-16**

**Reached: every field with `enemyExit: rollRequired`** — Asterios's Chaos Labyrinthos today, and
the shape Ch. 43 §43.4 defines for all of them.

`rules/bounded-fields.mjs#escapeAttempt` implements the whole ladder — base chance, `+N` per
failure, border contact, remaining MOV, relocation on failure, and the veteran clause that lets an
escapee lead adjacent allies out — and **its only callers are its own twelve unit tests**.
`rules/movement.mjs:364` asks `membershipVerdict(field, unit, "exit", board)` and treats a `false`
as a refusal, which is the conflation that module's own docstring warns against in these words:

> `rollRequired` is **not** a refusal — it is a refusal *of the free move*, and the caller is
> expected to offer `escapeAttempt`. **Conflating the two would turn the Labyrinth from a puzzle
> into a wall.**

It was a wall. **Measured before the fix**: an enemy standing on the inner border with 3 MOV left,
where `escapeAttempt` returned `{ok: true, chance: 20}`, was refused by the interface with *"FGT |
Step 1 passes through a panel this Unit may not enter."* Interior movement was allowed; leaving was
impossible by any means short of the field expiring or its owner dying. Clauses 5 and 9 of Chaos
Labyrinthos — roughly half its printed text — could never happen.

**Three seams closed it**, and the shape of the gap is worth keeping:

1. **`canAttemptEscape`**, split out of `escapeAttempt`. The only entry point needed a *die*, and
   nothing in the interface had a reason to roll one — so the ladder could not be offered without
   first being resolved. The action bar asks the gate; the engine rolls.
2. **An `escape` action** (`rules/actions.mjs`), offered to a unit inside a boundary that answers
   `rollRequired`. It bills no ActionKind: the Move it is part of is already paid for, and the
   remaining movement is what buys the roll. It is offered even when the gate refuses, so the
   button can *say* `notAtBorder` — an absent button teaches a player nothing.
3. **`field.state.mayExit`**, the transient pass a success buys, honoured by `membershipVerdict`.
   Without it the roll would be won and then refused by the very gate it beat. It is spent by
   being outside, not by a clock, and is **distinct from the veteran mark**: clause 9 grants a
   re-entering escapee *"Base Success Chance … increased to 100%"* — a better roll, not free
   passage.

**Measured live, end to end**: 20% rolled 12 → failed, relocated to a random interior panel,
*"Next attempt: 25%"*; 25% rolled 14 → failed; 30% rolled 12 → failed; **35% rolled 7 → escaped**;
`escapeHistory` read `{failures: 3, escaped: true}`, the token then moved out of the boundary with
no refusal, the pass cleared itself on the next entry sweep, and a re-entry gate answered
`{ok: true, chance: 100, automatic: true, reason: "veteran"}`.

### I. A field's isolation covered targeting but not effect application — **fixed 2026-09-16**

Clause 10 of Chaos Labyrinthos is *"Units outside the Labyrinth cannot **Attack or apply any
effects** to Units within the Labyrinth and vice versa."* `isolationBlocks` implements the first
half and is called from one place — `rules/targeting/resolve.mjs:220`, the legality filter. The
second half has a field authored for it, `outsideCanApplyEffectsInside`, **which nothing reads**.

`rules/auras.mjs` filtered on distance and relation and never consulted isolation, so an aura
crossed the boundary freely in both directions. Medea's Territory Creation is `scope: "field"` —
explicitly unbounded — so it reached inside a Labyrinth from anywhere on the board, through a wall
the same field refuses every attack.

`isolationBlocksEffect` is the reader the authored field never had, and `anyBoundaryBlocksEffect`
is what `collectAuras` asks. **Both** directions and both keys: the sheet says *"and vice versa"*,
and the Labyrinth only ever authored the inward one — `insideCanApplyEffectsOutside` is now stated
beside it, the way `outsideCanTargetInside` and `insideCanTargetOutside` already sit in a pair.

Targeting and effect application stay **separate keys**, because a field may legitimately seal one
and not the other; a boundary that states neither is unchanged.

**Measured live**: with Medea standing outside an open Labyrinth and an enemy inside,
`anyBoundaryBlocksEffect` reads `true` across the boundary and `false` for a unit on her own side,
and no aura reaches the trapped unit. The unit test is red-green: flipping the gate off lets the
`scope: "field"` aura straight through.

`visibilityAcrossBoundary` is still unread, and stays so deliberately: every authored field states
the permissive value, so it is a completed axis rather than a defect. It becomes one the day a
sheet restricts sight across a boundary.

### G. `recordUse` dropped the charge count — **fixed 2026-09-16**

**Reached: any ability-borne `RevivalSource` with `charges` and `cascading`.** Only God Hand today,
but the shape is general — the ledger is the same `timesUsed` counter every whole-match limit
spends. `resolveRevival` returned the right `chargesUsed` throughout and `spendRevival` threw it
away; the **effect**-borne branch beside it had always passed the count to `consumeUse`. Ch. 31
§31.7a.

## 46.5 The per-Servant checklist

Run all of it. An item that is obviously inapplicable is still an item you looked at.

**Statblock**
- [ ] Parameters, Base Health, MOV, Range/targets, Base Attack, Sustainability, alignment, region, attributes all match the sheet.
- [ ] Base Health derives from the END table; a sheet figure that disagrees is the table's to win only where the rulebook says so (§46.6).
- [ ] Attributes carry nothing the sheet does not list — and nothing granted twice (an attribute in the base list *and* from a class skill).

**Per ability**
- [ ] Every clause of the description has an element, and every element has a reader that is reached.
- [ ] Rank-table values match the figures the sheet prints for **this Servant's rank**, including the `[normal, vsNP]` pairs.
- [ ] Cooldowns, durations and counts parse to the right number of Turns (`◈` arithmetic, including the `±⅓◈` forms).
- [ ] Anything the sheet does **not** state a number for inherits from the unit rather than freezing a literal (§46.3, "absolute where the sheet is silent").
- [ ] Timing window is the one the sheet describes — a reaction is offered on the ladder, not only on the owner's Turn.
- [ ] Riders fire on the condition the sheet names, not on a proxy (`damageDealt` is "a hit that landed", which is not "inflicts").

**Class skills**
- [ ] The shared template's clauses **all** appear on this sheet. If not, §46.4-C is the pattern.
- [ ] A slug the template states by hand still matches what predicates name (camelCase, not the kebab-case id).

**On the board**
- [ ] Imported fresh from the compiled pack, in a match, with **one** GM connection.
- [ ] Every ability pressed through the interface; refusals read and understood rather than worked around.
- [ ] The sheet's own numbers checked after each press — the counters, the cost lines, the modifier provenance list.
- [ ] Chat card and audit log agree with the sheet. A disagreement between them is §46.3's "gate and display" shape.

---

## 46.6 Not defects

Recorded so they are not filed again.

- **Max Health is derived from END and the table beats the sheet**, as Base Attack's does. This was
  raised by the Asterios audit as an open question — his sheet prints 1500 where END A++ derives
  1700 — and **settled by the game's author: it is overridden.** `domain/health.mjs#maxHealthFor`.
  Four sheets disagree and every one disagrees downward: Asterios, Castor and Pollux print 1500
  against 1700, Penthesilea 1250 against 1350. The authored figure survives only where there is no
  parameter to derive from, which is summons and platforms.

- **An authored `baseAttack` is overwritten by the STR/MAG table.** Deliberate, and
  `domain/base-attack.mjs` quotes the rulebook doing it: *"If you find a value of Base attack that
  differs from this calculation choose the value of this table instead of what is on the character
  sheet."* Three of the eleven authored sheets disagree with the table; the table wins.
- **The revival chain tries only the best available source.** If Undying fires, fails and is spent,
  God Hand's eleven charges are not consulted. That matches §31.2's own pseudocode exactly. It is a
  reading of the sheet's priority list, not an oversight — but it is a *reading*, and it is the
  kind of thing to put to the game's author rather than to re-derive per Servant.
- **Overkill is subtracted from every revival source.** Only God Hand's text carries the excess
  clause; `rules/revival.mjs` generalises it and Ch. 31 says so in those words. Same status as
  above.

## 46.8 Asterios — what was his own

Audited 2026-09-16. The statblock, all seven clauses of Mad Enhancement, Natural Monster, Avyssos
of Labrys and eight of Chaos Labyrinthos's ten clauses hold. Measured on a live board: the
Labyrinth opens at **81 panels**, Asterios's MOV reads **10** inside (4 base, +2 Mad Enhancement,
+4 interior), the enemy's reads **5** (7 − 2), the activation debuffs land, and the Noble Phantasm
deals **0** damage as *"(Non-damaging)"* requires.

Two of his four findings are general and live in §46.4-H and §46.4-I. The two that were his, both
now fixed:

- **The preview promised damage a non-damaging Noble Phantasm would not deal.** The confirmation
  dialog offered *"AT Foe 192 – 264"*; the resolution dealt 0 and the log agreed. `dealsNoDamage`
  was applied in `engine/attack.mjs` when it builds the base spec and **not** by the preview, which
  fell back to the caster's Normal Attack the way the resolver itself used to. The §46.3 shape is
  "the gate and the display disagree", and it is §46.4-A with the sides reversed: there the sheet
  under-promised what the engine allowed, here it over-promised.

  The predicate moved to `rules/ability-use.mjs`, beside `classifyAbility`, because the preview is
  layer 2 and could not reach into the engine to ask. One definition, two readers. **Measured
  live**: the dialog now shows the target with no damage figure at all.

- **Monstrous Strength read *"PASSIVE — ALWAYS IN EFFECT"* on his sheet.** It is *"(Active) Used at
  the start of a Damage Step when performing an Attack"* with a 3◈ Cooldown, and it always **was**
  offered correctly at that window — the Damage Step dialog names it. `classifyAbility` had
  answered `kind: "windowed"` since he needed it; the ability card had no branch for that kind, so
  every non-clickable ability fell through to the passive label.

  It now names the window: **"Active — offered at: Start of the Damage Step"**. The wrong label was
  wrong in the direction that matters — a player reading *"always in effect"* does not go looking
  for the prompt, and does not know a Cooldown is being spent when they answer it.
